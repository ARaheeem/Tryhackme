# 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Learning Log

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning log! This repository showcases hands-on labs, challenges, and core concepts I've completed through **TryHackMe** and other sources, with a focus on developing and demonstrating my skills as an aspiring penetration tester. Each entry reflects real-world techniques, tools, and methodologies—including reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation—aligned with industry best practices and certification standards.

🌐 This repo serves as a living portfolio of my progress and passion for ethical hacking, technical problem-solving, and continuous learning in the field of cybersecurity.


## ✅ Completed Modules

Here are the modules I've completed so far:

- 🔍 **Passive Reconnaissance** – Leveraging OSINT to gather intel without touching targets directly.
- 🎯 **Active Reconnaissance** – Probing live systems using tools like Nmap and Gobuster.
- 🌐 **Content Discovery** – Discovering hidden files and directories in web applications.
- 🌎 **Subdomain Enumeration** – Mapping a broader attack surface via subdomain discovery.
- 🔓 **Authentication Bypass** – Exploiting weak authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
- 🔄 **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** – Accessing unintended resources through insecure parameter handling.
- 🗂️ **File Inclusion** – Exploiting local and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.
- 🌐 **Intro to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** – Forcing servers to make internal HTTP requests.
- 💉 **SQL Injection** – Manipulating backend SQL queries to extract or modify database contents.
- **Net Sec Challange**: demenstrated passive and active reconnaissance, service and protocol enumeration ,credential brute-forcing and network-based exploitation methodology
